Cutaneous anthrax accounts for most of the cases in endemic situation., <br>Cutaneous, <br>or skin, <br>anthrax is the most common form. It is usually contracted when a person with a break in their skin, <br>such as a cut or abrasion, <br>comes into direct contact with anthrax spores. The resulting itchy bump rapidly develops into a black sore. Some people can then develop headaches, <br>muscle aches, <br>fever and vomiting. Cutaneous anthrax usually occurs after exposure to infected animals or their contaminated tissues and products such as hair, <br>hides, <br>wool, <br>bones and skin., <br>Gastrointestinal anthrax is caught from eating meat from an infected animal. It causes initial symptoms similar to food poisoning but these can worsen to produce severe abdominal pain, <br>vomiting of blood and severe diarrhea., <br>Pulmonary anthrax- The most severe form of human anthrax is called inhalation or pulmonary anthrax. Though the rarest, <br>it is the form of human anthrax causing the most current concern. This form of the disease is caused when a person is directly exposed to a large number of anthrax spores suspended in the air, <br>and breathes them in. The first symptoms are similar to those of a common cold, <br>but this can rapidly progress to severe breathing difficulties and shock., <br>References- http://www.who.int/csr/disease/Anthrax/anthraxfaq/en/, <br>','https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/anthrax');

Amoebic liver abscess presents with fever and right upper quadrant abdominal pain., <br>Other organs can also be involved, <br>including pleuropulmonary, <br>cardiac, <br>cerebral, <br>renal, <br>genitourinary, <br>peritoneal, <br>and cutaneous sites.

Partial impairment presents as ascending or descending curtain or a blind moving sideways across the eye. Visual field defect is complete or partial.

It is due to vasospasm and migraine. Visual field defect is complete and may lead to progressive contraction.

insert into disease_details (Source,disease,symptoms,href) values ('https://www.nhp.gov.in','Frost Bite','At or below 0 °C (32 °F), <br>blood vessels close to the skin start to constrict, <br>and blood is shunted away from the extremities via the action of the glomus bodies (glomus bodies are most numerous in the fingers and toes. The role of the glomus body is to shunt blood away from the skin surface when exposed to cold temperature, <br>thus preventing heat loss, <br>and on the other hand, <br>it allows maximum heat flow to the skin in warm weather, <br>to allow heat dissipation. The glomus body has a high sympathetic tone and its potentiation leads to near complete vasoconstriction). There are four degrees of frostbite. Each of these degrees has varying degrees of pain., <br>First degree: It is known as frost nip. It only affects the surface of   skin, <br>which is exposed. On the onset, <br>there is itching and pain, <br>and then the skin develops white, <br>red, <br>and yellow patches and becomes numb. The area affected by frost nip usually does not become permanently damaged as only the skins top layers are affected., <br>Second degree:  If skin is exposed to cold for longer duration, <br>then it may freeze and harden, <br>but the deep tissues are generally not affected and remain soft and normal. Second-degree injury causes blister formation after about one or two days of exposure. The blisters may become hard and blackened, <br>but usually appear worse than they are. Most of the injuries heal in about one month, <br>but the area may become permanently insensitive to both heat and cold., <br>Third and fourth degrees: If the exposed area freezes further, <br>deep frostbite occurs. The muscles, <br>tendons, <br>blood vessels, <br>and nerves all freeze. The skin becomes hard, <br>feels waxy, <br>and the area is lost temporarily, <br>and may be permanent in severe cases. The deep frostbite results in areas of purplish blisters which turn black and which are generally blood-filled. Nerve damage in the area can result in   loss of sensations. This extreme frostbite   in fingers and toes, <br>may require amputation, <br>if the area becomes infected with gangrene. If the frostbite has not treated, <br>it may fall off. The extent of   damage done to the area by  freezing process of   frostbite may take several months to assess, <br>and this often delays surgery to remove the dead tissue., <br>References: www.nhs.uk\nwww.cdc.gov\n , <br>','https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/frost-bite');

In more severe cases all the enamel may be damaged (however, <br>fluoride may not be the only cause of dental enamel defects; enamel opacities similar to dental fluorosis are associated with other conditions, <br>such as vitamins A and D deficiency or a low protein-energy diet). Ingestion of fluoride after six years of age will not cause dental fluorosis. The teeth could be chalky white and may have white, <br>yellow, <br>brown or black spots or streaks on the enamel surface. Discolouration is away from the gums and bilaterally symmetrical., <br>Skeletal fluorosis: The early symptoms of skeletal fluorosis, <br>include stiffness and pain in the joints. In severe cases, <br>the bone structure may change and ligaments may calcify, <br>with resulting impairment of muscles and pain. Constriction of vertebral canal and intervertebral foramen exerts pressure on nerves, <br>blood vessels leading to paralysis and pain., <br>Gastrointestinal symptoms: Abdominal pain, <br>excessive saliva, <br>nausea and vomiting are seen after acute high-level exposure to fluoride., <br>Neurological manifestation: Nervousness and depression, <br>tingling sensation in fingers and toes, <br>excessive thirst and tendency to urinate, <br>Muscular manifestations: Muscle weakness & stiffness, <br>pain in the muscle and loss of muscle power, <br>inability to carry out normal routine activities., <br>Allergic manifestation: Skin rashes, <br>Perivascular inflammation: pinkish red or bluish red spot, <br>round or oval shape on the skin that fade and clear up within 7-10 days., <br>Effects on foetus: Fluoride can also damage a foetus, <br>if the mother consumes water/food with high concentrations of fluoride during pregnancy/breast feeding. Abortions, <br>still births and children with birth defects are common in endemic areas., <br>Low haemoglobin levels: Fluoride accumulates on the erythrocyte (red blood cells) membrane, <br>which in turn looses calcium content. The membrane which is deficient in calcium content is pliable and is thrown into folds. The shape of erythrocytes is changed. Such RBCs are called echinocytes, <br>and found in circulation. The echinocytes undergo phagocytosis (eaten-up by macrophages) and are eliminated from circulation. This would lead to low haemoglobin levels in patients chronically ill due to fluoride toxicity., <br>Urinary tract manifestations Urine may be much less in volume; yellow-red in colour and itching in the region may occur., <br>Ligaments and blood vessel calcification: A unique feature of the disease is soft tissues like ligaments, <br>blood vessels tend to harden and calcify and the blood vessels may be blocked.','https://www.nhp.gov.in/disease/non-communicable-disease/fluorosis');

Paralytic symptoms generally begin 1 to 10 days after minor illness symptoms and progress for 2 to 3 days. Generally, <br>no further paralysis occurs after the temperature returns to normal. Some signs and symptoms can include a loss of superficial reflexes, <br>initially increased deep tendon reflexes and severe muscle aches and spasms in the limbs or back.
